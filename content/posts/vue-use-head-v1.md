Hey there, firstly welcome to my blog. My name is Harlan and I took over the maintenance of [@vueuse/head](https://github.com/vueuse/head) from [EGOIST](https://github.com/sponsors/egoist)
in October.

EGOIST did an amazing job with the package, and I'm grateful to continue the work he started.

I'll be providing some background information for this release, and then go over the new features and breaking changes. 
Feel free to jump straight to the [release notes](#v100-release).

## Changes leading to up to v1

My goals for taking of maintenance was closing all open issues for the package, improve performance, documentation and DX.

Notable changes:
- Full `useHead` TypeScript support powered by [zhead](https://github.com/harlan-zw/zhead) - [6f919c7](https://github.com/vueuse/head/pull/85)
- Computer getter support - [b6d74dbeb](https://github.com/vueuse/head/commit/b6d74dbebd32f772923f722c399091c73e21b6ed)
- Significant performance improvements - [e1bc8d2](https://github.com/vueuse/head/commit/e1bc8d2e35a9104adbd3a62c29bdadb89181b3fc), [691bcc8](https://github.com/vueuse/head/commit/691bcc88ae3526879238995866daeec39e8bc4c6)
- Vue 2.7 support - [d6ece59c3d843a5fa82d7c2bb29e76b1c73ac05d](https://github.com/vueuse/head/pull/147) (thanks to vetruvet)

## Why a major bump - v1?

While most issues were closed and easy to solve, there was a major outstanding issue that I wanted to address, *Server Only Tags* (see [discussion](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/discussions/7785)). 
There was also a nasty issue with tags disappearing unexpectedly when hydrating.

Both of these were blocked by how the DOM patching was designed. The old strategy was to add state to the DOM and use this
to determine what tags to remove.

```html
<html data-head-attrs="lang,dir">
<head>
<meta name="head:count" content="29">
</head>
<body data-head-attrs="class">
</body>
</html>
```

You can see in the above, we're tracking the attributes being added and the number of tags. The `head:count` element
is used as an anchor to start rendering tags from.

It would take all tags to be rendered, check the dom elements upwards from the `head:count` meta tag if any needed to be inserted
or if they already existed, otherwise delete them.

This had a issues when you look closely:

### Deleting DOM elements it doesn't own

It would modify whatever element is in the position regardless if it's an element created from `@vueuse/head`. 

This led to issues with a third-party script inserting something in between these DOM elements, and it getting deleted.

Any type of hydration where you wanted to have the server tags differ, would be impossible without introducing more DOM state.

### State in DOM isn't so nice

Purely from a DX perspective, it's not nice to have state in the DOM that isn't needed. It's not a big deal, but it's not ideal.

### Performance

Previous DOM patching would delete and re-render tags which shared dedupe keys. Not noticable functionally but a performance consideration.

To solve these issues, a new DOM patching algorithm was needed that tracked side effects gracefully.

## Unhead

This was a major piece of work, and I figured if I'm going to have to refactor the entire package, I should aim to also solve
another outstanding issue, _Universal Head Management_.

So I started on [Unhead](https://github.com/harlan-zw/unhead), a Universal document <head> tag manager, that's tiny, adaptable, and full-featured.

And I'm happy to say that it's now being used in @vueuse/head v1.

Unhead has first-party support for Vue, but there is planned work to support many other frameworks (React, Svelte, etc).

With this in mind @vueuse/head is a thin wrapper for unhead, but provides legacy head functions (i.e `addHeadObjs`) and
provides the `<Head>` component.

## v1.0.0 Release

### ü§ñ Core

Now powered by [Unhead](https://github.com/harlan-zw/unhead).

Featuring a new DOM patching algorithm that tracks side effects gracefully, less aggressive removal of tags and attributes

Includes :zap:  DOM rendering optimisations, 120% (~10ms for an avg site) faster, async for quicker initial main thread load.

### ‚ú® Enhancements

- Vue 2.7 Support  ([docs](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/integrations/vue/setup))
- Options API Support ([docs](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/integrations/vue/options-api))


#### htmlAttrs / bodyAttrs merging

[Documentation](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/guide/guides/handling-duplicates#tagduplicatestrategy)

Now merged by default instead of replace.

```ts
useHead({
  htmlAttrs: {
    class: 'my-class',
  },
})
// we don't want that class to be on a specific page, instead we want a new class
useHead({
  htmlAttrs: {
    class: 'another-class',
  },
})
// <html class="my-class another-class">
```


#### Array / Object Classes

[Documentation](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/guide/guides/class-attr)

When using the htmlAttrs or bodyAttrs options, you can use the class attribute to add classes to the html or body elements.

```ts
const darkMode = false
useHead({
  htmlAttrs: {
    class: {
      // will be rendered
      'dark': darkMode,
      // will not be rendered
      'light': !darkMode,
    }
  },
  bodyAttrs: { class: ['layout-id', 'page-id' ] }
})
```

#### Better deduping

[Documentation](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/guide/guides/handling-duplicates#using-arrays-with-meta)

Tag deduping is now vastly improved. It's likely you won't need `key` anymore.

Includes support for meta content array support, reduces boilerplate by using arrays for meta tags.

```ts
useHead({
  meta: [
    {
      name: 'og:image',
      content: [
        'https://example.com/image.png',
        'https://example.com/image2.png',
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

### üöÄ New Features

#### useServerHead

[Documentation](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/guide/guides/server-only-tags)

Lets you render tags on the server only. This has the same API as `useHead`.

```ts
useServerHead({
  scripts: [
    {
      // this wouldn't work on the client, so we use useServerHead
      src: () => import('~/assets/my-script.js?url'),
    }
  ]
})
```

#### useSeoMeta

[Documentation](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/guide/guides/useseometa)

Define meta tags in a flat object, fully typed.

```ts
useSeoMeta({
  description: 'My about page',
  ogDescription: 'Still about my about page',
  ogTitle: 'About',
  ogImage: 'https://example.com/image.png',
  twitterCard: 'summary_large_image',
})
```

#### tagPosition

[Documentation](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/guide/guides/positions)

Lets you define the position of a tag in the DOM.

```ts
useHead({
  script: [
    {
      src: 'https://example.com/script.js',
      tagPosition: 'bodyOpen',
    }
  ]
})
```

#### tagPriority

[Documentation](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/guide/guides/sorting)

Lets you define the priority of a tag with a number or string.

```ts
useHead({
  script: [{ key: 'not-important', src: '/not-important-script.js',},],
})
useHead({
  script: [
    {
      // script is the tag name to target, `not-important` is the key we're targeting  
      tagPriority: 'before:script:not-important',
      src: '/must-be-first-script.js',
    },
  ],
})
```


#### tagDuplicateStrategy

[Documentation](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/guide/guides/handling-duplicates#tagduplicatestrategy)


#### DOM Event Handlers

[Documentation](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/guide/guides/dom-event-handling)

Function support for DOM event handlers.

```ts
useHead({
  bodyAttrs: {
    onresize: (e) => {
      console.log('resized', e)
    }
  },
  script: [
    {
      src: 'https://example.com/analytics.js',
      onload: (el) => {
        console.log('loaded', el)
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

#### Hooks

Engine is now powered by hooks, provided by [hookable](https://github.com/unjs/hookable). This allows you to hook into
any of the core functionality.

See [API hooks](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/api/core/create-head) and [Infer SEO MetaTags](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/guide/recipes/infer-seo-meta-tags), not documented properly yet.

#### New shortcut composables

Same API as `useHead`, but targeted as a specific tag type.

- useTagTitle
- useTagBase
- useTagMeta
- useTagLink
- useTagScript
- useTagStyle
- useTagNoscript
- useHtmlAttrs
- useBodyAttrs
- useTitleTemplate

## Migration Guide

‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes are minimal, but there are some changes to be aware of.

Please report any issues you find and they will fixed be promptly.

You may consider using [@unhead/vue](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/integrations/vue/setup) directly if you [don't need @vueuse/head](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/integrations/vue/vueuse-head).

### Verify your tags

The new DOM patching algorithm has not been tested in all possible scenarios, it's possible that there are unforeseen edge cases.

### `htmlAttrs` and `bodyAttrs` merge strategy

If you had built your code around with the assumption that setting `htmlAttrs` or `bodyAttrs` would clear the old tags, this is now different.

```ts
// old
useHead({
  htmlAttrs: {
    class: 'my-class',
  },
})

useHead({
  htmlAttrs: {
    class: 'new-class',
  },
})

// <html class="new-class">
```

```ts
// new
useHead({
  htmlAttrs: {
    class: 'my-class',
  },
})

useHead({
  htmlAttrs: {
    class: 'new-class',
  },
})

// <html class="my-class new-class">
```

Check the [documentation](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/guide/guides/handling-duplicates#tagduplicatestrategy) to learn more.


### Duplicate tags in the same entry allowed

To make duplicate tag handling more intuitive, duplicate tags are now allowed in the same entry.

Having these metas across `useHead`'s will still dedupe as before.

```ts
// old
useHead({
  meta: [
    { name: 'description', content: 'foo' },
    { name: 'description', content: 'bar' },
  ],
})

// only the last tag is rendered
// <meta name="description" content="bar">
```

```ts
// old
useHead({
  meta: [
    { name: 'description', content: 'foo' },
    { name: 'description', content: 'bar' },
  ],
})

// both are rendered
// <meta name="description" content="foo">
// <meta name="description" content="bar">
```
