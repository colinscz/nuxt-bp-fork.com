Hey! My name is Harlan Wilton. Thank you for checking out my site üòä

## Overview

### üë®‚Äçüíª Working full time for myself 

Starting December 2020, I have moved to working for myself full time.

Whilst working professionally full time for the last few years I have felt a consistent hum of burn out. 

There was an underlying tension from not having the time to work on what I wanted to work on. A tension from the stacks 
of unanswered emails from my freelancing client that I haven't had the time to answer. Feeling guilty for taking time off
when I needed it.

I have no idea how long I can last, but at least I now have better balance. The goal is to earn enough money to support
working for myself.

### :hammer: Trying to build profitable SaaS projects with Laravel & Vue

The primary way I want to support myself is through building profitable SaaS projects. Laravel and Vue are the stacks I'm 
currently using and plan to continue to use.

I've been working on a side project for the past 6 months, I haven't made a lot of progress, but I plan to launch the
landing page and share details soon.

### :writing_hand: Sharing my journey along the way

I want to be able to motivate others to take the plunge having work-lifestyle that works for them, the best way I can do
 that is by sharing my journey and making it work.

I'll be posting here, <a href="https://twitter.com/harlan_zw" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/harlanzw" target="_blank">IndieHackers</a> for now.


### :money_with_wings: $0 MRR so far

Being transparent about how my journey is going is important to me. I want people to see what it really takes to move the needle.
I plan to build my projects in public, you'll see my MRR be updated as I go along.
