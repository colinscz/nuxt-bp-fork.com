# Harlan Wilton :i-line-md-coffee-loop{class="ml-2 text-emerald-400"}

Hey there! I'm a full-stack web developer from :i-heroicons-outline-location-marker{class="opacity-75"} _Sydney, Australia_. 

I'm passionate about building delightful [open source](https://github.com/harlan-zw) projects. I support myself financially as a [freelancer](/work-with-me).

I'm an avid consumer of [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122898515-harlan-wilton), [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/22ryw6esbmedc7fxo75rfw7ia?si=8505d295412e45c2), coffee and craft beer.


## Open Source

Creating delightful open-source packages is what I'm passionate about.

I work with <a href="https://nuxtjs.org" target="_blank" class="flex items-center"> :i-logos-nuxt-icon Nuxt.js</a> and :i-logos-laravel Laravel.

Occasionally I write articles, check my latest here:

## Freelancing

I worked at an [agency](https://4mation.com.au) and then a [startup](https://kintell.com) for many years while freelancing on the side. 

With wanting to pursue open-source and SaaS development, I decided to leave my full-time job and keep my freelancing going.

These days I have limited capacity for new work, but I'm always interested to hear about opportunities.
If you're interested in working with me, check the [work with me](/work-with-me) page.

The great companies I get to work with are mostly using  :i-logos-nuxt-icon Nuxt.js</a> and :i-logos-laravel Laravel.
