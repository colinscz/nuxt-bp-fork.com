# Harlan Wilton :i-line-md-coffee-loop

Hey, welcome to my site :)

I'm Harlan, a full-stack web developer living in :i-emojione-v1-flag-for-australia{class="ml-2 mr-1"} _Sydney, Australia_. 

I'm passionate about contributing to [open-source](https://github.com/harlan-zw). I like to build packages that delight while
learning the inner complexities of the Vue, Nuxt and Vite ecosystems. 

I'm part of the [:windi-icon WindiCSS](https://windicss.com) and [:i-logos-vueuse{class="mx-1"} VueUse](https://vueuse.org) team and proudly [sponsored](/sponsors) by many great people and companies. Sometimes I [write articles](/blog).

When not coding, you can find me:
- üèÉüèãÔ∏è Working out 
- ‚òïüç∫ At a coffee roaster or craft brewery
- üìö Reading [non-fiction](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122898515-harlan-wilton) 
- ü•ê Eating almond croissants 
- üèûÔ∏è Or maybe in front of a waterfall...

## Open Source Journey

At the end of 2020, I finished up my full-time job at a [startup](https://kintell.com/). I wanted to explore other ways of working,
with the idea of building a SaaS product.

Though, without an idea I was passionate about and no audience, it felt like a waste of time.

Instead, I decided to focus on learning as much as I could within the Vue ecosystem. 

I started building my [old blog](https://old.harlanzw.com)
in the earliest version of VitePress and did an article comparing [Vite to webpack](/blog/how-the-heck-does-vite-work).

In setting up Twitter and sharing that article, I was hooked.

I started writing more, contributing issues and building my own [vue plugin](/blog/vue-automatic-component-imports).

Through these I grew my audience and started focusing on [Nuxt modules](/projects) and joined the [WindiCSS](htttp://windicss.com) team.

Since then, I've been working on all sorts of projects. While the progress has been slow while I've been learning, I'm proud of what I've accomplished, 
and I'm looking forward to working on more interesting projects.

## Freelance Laravel and Nuxt Developer

When not creating open-source, I work for myself as a freelancer. 

Working with my clients, I create scalable, profit driven web apps and SEO, performant marketing sites built with :i-logos-nuxt-icon Nuxt and :i-logos-laravel{class="h-1.2em w-1.2em ml-2 mr-1"} Laravel.

While I have limited capacity for new work, I'd love to hear from you if you think I could help your business grow.
