## Personal Updates

### Travel

In May we finished up our time in Thailand and traveled to South Korea.

In total, we had 2 weeks for South Korea, with a week in Seoul followed by Busan and Jeju.

We found South Korea really amazing:

**Seoul**

Amazing city and a great introduction to the Korean culture.
It's not really set up for backpackers but there was an endless
number of things to do.

We were staying in the shopping distict, known for it's skin care products.

Favorite thing was climbing the mountain.

**Busan**

Cool coastal city

**Jeju**

Amazing, climbed  amountain

## Work Updates / Financials

Time spent in front of a screen took a small hit, but still managed to get many hours in.

### Open-Source

My open-source time was mostly spent being reactive. Trying to solve many of the issues coming in to my Nuxt modules.

- ‚åõ 70.75 hrs  (-17.25 hrs)
- üí∏ $1,013 AUD (+$226) - Had a payout from the Windi CSS project as it was sunset.
- $14.32 AUD / hour (+$5.38 / hour) - Highest yet! Although this was mostly a one-off.

**Main projects**

- **34 hours [nuxt-og-image](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-og-image)**

More time spent wrestling WASM issues on different Nitro providers. I managed to get things
much more stable, although Netlify still has issues with PNG images.


- **16.5 hours [nuxt-simple-sitemap](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-simple-sitemap)**

The Nuxt Simple Sitemap logic got quite a bit more complex than I initially anticipated. The issues mainly related
to generated a sitemap at runtime while still honoring prerendered, discovered URLs.

Much of this time was on stabilising these improvements.
The feedback has been very positive to the fixes and the module overall.

- **6 hours [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt)** 

Not too much on Nuxt, mainly some triaging and minor fixes.

### Freelancing

- ‚åõ 2.25 hrs (-4.75 hrs)
- üí∏ $225 AUD (-$420) 645
- $100 AUD / hour (-$7 / hour)

I tried to avoid freelance work this month.
I did have some work come in, in fact two organic leads.
But I decided to push this work back to May as I wanted to focus on my open-source work
and wasn't sure how my availability would be.

## May plans

In April I wanted to get Nuxt SEO Kit v2 out.
The blocker I came across was some of the modules not being stable enough (nuxt-og-image and nuxt-simple-sitemap).
These are now mostly resolved, although there is one outstanding issues for nuxt-og-image.

In starting to identify what changes are needed for v2 as well, I identified a bunch of scope that I hadn't considered.

So likely v2 of Nuxt SEO Kit will be a couple of months away still, but I will keep chipping away at it.

## Final thoughts

It was a really fun month in Thailand, I had a good balance of work and travelling.
It's never satisfying just working on bugs and issues, there's not much to show for it.

But this is the way open-source works it seems.
Periods of rapid development and then periods of slow but steady maintenance to get things stable.

And that's a wrap. Thanks for reading and thanks to my amazing sponsors.
