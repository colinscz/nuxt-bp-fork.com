## Paid Work

When not creating open-source, I work for myself as a freelance developer.

I partner with business to create sites that users and search engines love. With a focus
on UX, SEO and performance. I build with :icon{name="logos:nuxt-icon"
alt="Nuxt Icon"} Nuxt and :icon{name="logos:laravel" class="h-1.2em w-1.2em ml-2 mr-1" alt="Laravel Icon"} Laravel.

Feel free to [email me](mailto:harlan@harlanzw.com){title="Send an email to me at harlan@harlanzw.com"} any exciting opportunities you have.
